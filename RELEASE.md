**Release Date:** January 5, 2025

### Highlights

#### Expanded Two-Phase Flow Capabilities
- VOF-based interface tracking with an option for the conservative momentum advection module
- Added the reduced gravity approach for precise control over effective body forces

#### Improved HPC Support
- MPI integration for large-scale parallel runs on HPC clusters
- Refined instructions and Slurm scripts for streamlined deployment on typical HPC infrastructures

#### Enhanced Post-Processing Tools
- New Python scripts for 2D and 3D visualization (`Video2DSlice.py`, `Video3D.py`)
- Jupyter notebook (`Visualization3D.ipynb`) for interactive exploration of simulation data
- `getFacets3D.c` for interface extraction and geometric analysis

#### Robust Initialization Workflow
- Option to generate initial conditions in a single-threaded (OpenMP) run before migrating to MPI
- Automatic environment configuration via `.project_config` to minimize setup inconsistencies

### Bug Fixes
- Resolved mesh refinement edge cases when using `distance.h`
- Corrected velocity boundary conditions on domain walls for axisymmetric setups
- Addressed race conditions in OpenMP runs by clarifying memory allocation routines

### Known Issues
- Basilisk's `distance.h` remains incompatible with MPI, necessitating local initialization before parallel runs
- Some HPC environments require manual customization of compiler and library paths in `.project_config`

### Future Directions
- Addition of automated regression tests in `testCases/` for routine CI checks
- Enhancements to post-processing scripts for slice-by-slice interface tracking
- Further optimization of load balancing in MPI runs
